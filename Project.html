        <h1>Adverse impacts of alcohol on UK society</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">Portfolio</a></li>

        </ul>

        <h2>1. Aims of the Project</h2>
        <p>
        Alcohol is a relatively small industry in the UK, contributing roughly 2.5% of the total GDP. 
        However, it causes many social problems, most of which are hidden from view. 
        Hence this project aims to explore the harms that alcohol brings to the society. 
        It will look at the alcohol consumption picture and analyze the social harms in three aspects: transport safety, public security and healthcare system.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Consumption</h2>
        <div class="pchart" id="Chart1"> </div>
        <p>
        Figure 1 shows the alcohol consumption rate, measured by litres drinking per capita of pure alcohol in a year. 
        The data source is British Beer & Pub Association 
        and I downloaded the csv file from the <ul1><a href="https://www.ias.org.uk/factsheet/consumption/">Institute of Alcohol Studies</a></ul1>.   
        The Chief Medical Officiers' guidelines consider drinking up to 14 units a week as low or moderate health risk, where 1 unit is equal to 10ml of pure alcohol. 
        14 units a week is equal to 7 litres a year which is represented by the horizontal line.
        The graph illustrates the amount of alcohol consumed in the UK over the years is excessive as it kept beyond the low-risk level.
        </p>

        <div class="pchart" id="Chart2"> </div>
        <p>
        Figure 2 shows the adults' drinking habits in England regions. 
        The data is downloaded from <ul1><a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/local-alcohol-profiles/data#page/3/gid/1938133118/ati/402/iid/92763/age/168/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/1/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/car-do-0">Office for Health Improvement & Disparities (OHID henceforth)</a></ul1> in csv format. 
        The graph illustates that nearly 80% population in England drink alcohol and 20% population drink at a moderate or high-risk level.

        <h2>3. Crime & Transport</h2>
        <div class="pchart" id="Chart4"> </div>

        <p>
        Figure 3 illustrates the total number of violent incidents in England and Wales, and the proportion of it where the victim believed the offender(s) to be under the influence of alcohol.
        The data is downloaded from <ul1><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/thenatureofviolentcrimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2022">ONS</a></ul1> in csv format. 
        The graph indicates alcohol brings a huge adverse impact on public security as approximately 40% of all violent incidents are alcohol-related in recent 10 years.
        </p>

        <div class="pchart" id="Chart5"> </div>
        <p>
        Figure 4 shows the drink-drive road causalities and fatalities.
        The data is downloaded from the <ul1><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/reported-road-casualties-in-great-britain-final-estimates-involving-illegal-alcohol-levels-2020/reported-road-casualties-in-great-britain-final-estimates-involving-illegal-alcohol-levels-2020#contact-details">Department for Transport</a></ul1> in ods format. 
        The graph shows that since 2015, both rates keep rising. 
        One reason behind it might be the relatively loose drink-drive limit. Regulations in England and Wales are below 80mg alcohol per 100ml blood while Scotland and many other European countries are 50mg/100ml or even lower.

        <h2>4. Healthcare system</h2>
        <div class="pchart" id="Chart3"> </div>
        <p>
        Figure 5 measures the trends of alcohol-specific mortality rates in four UK constituent countries. 
        It refers to the death that is a direct result of alcohol misuse. 
        The data is downloaded from <ul1><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/alcoholrelateddeathsintheunitedkingdom/latest">ONS</a></ul1> in csv format.
        It implies that the rates have had an upper trend since 2012.
        </p>

        <div class="pchart" id="Chart6"> </div>
        <p>
        Figure 6 shows the components of alcohol-related costs to NHS in a year. The data is drawn from the Department of Health.
        It illustrates that alcohol-related incidents cost NHS Â£2.7 billion a year.
        The 2 major components are related to emergency services which indicate that alcohol-related callout is a significant burden.
        </p>
        <div class="pchart" id="Chart7"> </div>
        <p>
        Figure 7 is a map of England showing the alcohol-related admission episodes in each district. 
        Relevant data is downloaded from <ul1><a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/local-alcohol-profiles/data#page/3/gid/1938132833/pat/6/par/E12000007/ati/402/are/E09000002/iid/93764/age/1/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/1/cid/4/tbm/1">OHID</a></ul1> and the graph illustrates where is affected by alcohol more.
        </p>
        <div class="pchart" id="Chart8"> </div>
        <p>
        Figure 8 measures the correlation between the mortality rate from chronic liver disease and alcohol-related admissions.
        The data is drawn from <ul1><a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/local-alcohol-profiles/data#page/3/gid/1938132832/pat/6/par/E12000007/ati/402/are/E09000002/iid/91381/age/1/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/3/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/car-do-0">OHID</a></ul1> and the graph shows the two indicators have a positive correlation with 0.53 R^2.
        District with high alcohol-related admissions is more likely to have a high mortality rate from chronic liver disease.

        <h2>5. Limitations & Challenges</h2>
        <p>
        The limitation of the project is that some of the adverse impacts of alcohol are hard to quantify, 
        hence I found difficulties in getting time series data including specific values and most of them are written evidence.
        The challenges are that I am unable to find relevant APIs for this topic hence most of my data are in csv format.
        Secondly, the codes in some json files can produce the graph I want in vega-lite but it is in the wrong format on my main page.
        Therefore, I export those files in complied-vega format which solved this problem. 
        In addition, the map I used has several different district names with my data so I corrected it manually.

        <h2>6. Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
        In conclusion, the 8 graphs show the public health and safety burden of alcohol. 
        The consumption of it is excessive. 40% of violent incidents and 15% of road fatalities are related to alcohol.
        The prescription, admission and emergency services cost NHS a lot. The government may need to develop more policies to tackle the problems.
        However, alcohol industry may exert influences on the development of regulations. They can change the public perceptions of alcohol through some research or advertising.
        The jobs created by the industry and the taxes paid can be used to negotiate with the government.
        Hence further research can explore how to quantify those physical, mental and economic harms, compared to the benefit that the industry brings such as tax revenue and jobs.
